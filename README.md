# react-native-zebra-scanner

This is a zebra scanner implementation for react-native android.
A good portion of this code was copied from Diva-mobile-barcode-scanner (MIT license) and adapted to work with newer
android versions. The main point of this repository is to have something that actually builds in newer react-native
versions. There were several bugs in the diva implementation that were fixed in this repository. I would have opened a
PR and fixed it there, but the repository was taken down.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-zebra-scanner
```
Linking should be automatic. If not you need to use a newer version of react-native.
